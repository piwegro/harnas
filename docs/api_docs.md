## General flows

### User creation
1. User is created using the appropriate client side Google Firebase Auth method.
2. A call to the internal API is made by the client to create an entry in the database by
using the PUT method on the `/user/<id>` endpoint.

### Adding offers
1. Once the user has started uploading images, the client calls the POST method on the `/image` endpoint.
2. After all the images are successfully uploaded, the client calls the POST method on the `/offer` endpoint.
